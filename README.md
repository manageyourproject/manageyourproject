Many project management tools lack many features or have their features hidden behind a paywall. This tool aims to rectify that. 

## Why?
-------
I like working from terminal. As my projects grew more complex, and I needed to provide visuals like gantt charts, I wanted a project management/time tracking/todo list that i could use from the command line. While there are projects that do pieces of this, (see [taskwarrior](https://github.com/GothenbugBitFactory/taskwarrior), its related project [timewarrior](https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/timewarrior) and [taskjuggler](https://github.com/taskjuggler/taskjuggler) etc.) the options for a complete tool with all the features I needed/wanted was lacking.

## How?
-------
The project files are all done using json so that they are human readable, and easily modified in your favourite text editor.
